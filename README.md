# Appathematics

## Original VUE version (this has been re created/ improved in react https://github.com/TomF46/Appathematics)

Appathematics is a PWA (progressive web app) which allows you to race against the clock to answer randomly generated question sets of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of varying length and difficulty.

(This was created as an exercise and is not a commerical product)

This application is designed to work across multiple viewpoints and devices but is best enjoyed as a installed pwa on a device which supports PWAs fully which gives you an app icon on your home screen, and allows you to use it in offline mode.

Created using the Vue framework and implementing the following technolgies

- Service workers for offline PWA implemention
- Manifest.json file for PWA feature
- Webpack build system for pre processing and packaging
- Babel implemented in build system to ensure es6 is compiled as browser compatible
- Vuex for state management (The vue enviroments implementation of the Redux pattern)
- Jest testing framework for unit tests
- Nightwatch testing framework for end to end tests
